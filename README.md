# Presentation on Chapter 3 - Machine Learning with Shallow Neural Networks

## Purpose

This presentation was created for a **Political Science Deep Learning Seminar**, summarizing concepts from Chapter 3 of the book *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* by Charu C. Aggarwal. The focus is on **supervised** and **unsupervised models**, specifically **multiclass classification** and **autoencoders**.

## Overview

### Sections

1. **Supervised Models**
   - Introduction to **binary classification** models like perceptrons, support vector machines (SVMs), and logistic regression.
   - Exploration of **multiclass classification** using neural networks, including multinomial logistic regression (Softmax classifiers).
   
2. **Unsupervised Models**
   - **Autoencoders** for unsupervised learning, with an emphasis on dimensionality reduction and outlier detection.
   - Connections between linear autoencoders and singular value decomposition (SVD).
